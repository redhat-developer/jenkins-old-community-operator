Backup and Restore
-------------------

You can backup and restore your Jenkins data related to jobs, plugins or configurations with the Backup and Restore
feature provided by the Operator.

For this, you need, first, to enable the backup feature on the Operator managed Jenkins instance, then,
Use a *Backup* or *Restore* CustomResourceDefinition to trigger the backup or the restore.

Enable Backup for your Jenkins instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable backup for your Jenkins instance set `backupEnabled` to `true` in the Jenkins CR.

```yaml
apiVersion: jenkins.io/v1alpha2
kind: Jenkins
metadata:
  name: jenkins-with-backup-enabled
spec:
  backupEnabled: true
...
```

Once the Jenkins instance is created with Backup enabled, a `default` CustomResource of kind *BackupConfig* would be
created which would house the configuration for *Backup* and *Restore* for that instance. The *BackupConfig* instance
created would be called `default`.

_Create *Jenkins* with Backup enabled_

```shell
$ kubectl create -f config/samples/jenkins_v1alpha2_jenkins_with_backup.yaml
jenkins.jenkins.io/jenkins-with-backup-sample created

```
_List **BackupConfig**s_
```shell
$ kubectl get backupconfig
NAME      AGE
default   6s

```

Apart from that, a sidecar container called `backup` is created alongside the rest of the containers in the Pod which
aid in the backup and restore operations. This sidecar container is backed by a Volume which is mounted at
`/jenkins-backups` where all the backups are stored.


BackupConfig
~~~~~~~~~~~~
*BackupConfig* contains the configuration needed by the Backup and Restore controllers to carry out tasks before and
after a backup/restore job and also what exactly needs to be backed up and restored for a particular *Jenkins* instance.


The `default` *BackupConfig* created has everything enabled.

_Get `default` *BackupConfig* definition_

```shell
$ kubectl get backupconfig default -o yaml
apiVersion: jenkins.io/v1alpha2
kind: BackupConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: jenkins-backup-test
spec:
  jenkinsRef: jenkins-with-backup-sample
  backupOptions:
    config: true
    jobs: true
    plugins: true
  restartAfterRestore:
    enabled: true
    safe: true
```

A *BackupConfig* can be created by the user and then used for a particular Jenkins instance.

[NOTE]
====
To use a *BackupConfig* for a Jenkins instance, it is necessary for the *Jenkins* to have `.spec.backupEnabled` set
to `true`.
====

jenkinsRef
^^^^^^^^^^
This spec reflects which *Jenkins* instance is a particular *BackupConfig* meant for.

backupOptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This spec reflects what should be backed up from the *Jenkins* instance when backup is triggered.

`.spec.backupOptions.config` points to all the `xml` configuration files in the root of the Jenkins Home.

`.spec.backupOptions.jobs` points to the `jobs` directory in the Jenkins Home.

`.spec.backupOptions.plugins` points to the `plugins` directory in the Jenkins Home.

Backup
~~~~~~~

*Backup* contains the information necessary for triggering a backup for your *Jenkins*.

_Create a **Backup**_

```shell
$ kubectl create -f config/samples/jenkins_v1alpha2_backup.yaml
backup.jenkins.io/backup-sample created

```
_**Backup** `backup-sample` definition_

```yaml
apiVersion: jenkins.io/v1alpha2
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup-sample
  namespace: jenkins-backup-test
spec:
  configRef: default
```

A *Backup* is created with a *BackupConfig* in mind (noted in `.spec.configRef`) which contains information on the
*Jenkins* we are triggering the backup for. This has been done so that, one *Jenkins* instance can have multiple
**BackupConfig**s as not everytime, the same kind of *Backup* would be done.

Once the backup is complete we should be able to see the backup in the `/jenkins-backups/<backup-name>` directory.

[NOTE]
====
Only `.spec.backupOptions` from the *BackupConfig* are used for the *Backup* operations.
====


configRef
^^^^^^^^^
This spec reflects the *BackupConfig* which has to be used for performing the backup.

Restore
~~~~~~~
*Restore* contains the information necessary for triggering a restore for your *Jenkins* given that a *Backup* already
exists.

_Create a **Restore**_

```shell
$ kubectl create -f config/samples/jenkins_v1alpha2_restore.yaml
restore.jenkins.io/restore-sample created

```
_**Restore** `restore-sample` definition_

```yaml
apiVersion: jenkins.io/v1alpha2
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore-sample
  namespace: jenkins-backup-test
spec:
  backupRef: backup-sample
```

The restore operation would be responsible for moving the necessary files and folders from the backup directory present
in `/jenkins-backups` to the correct location in Jenkins Home.

[NOTE]
====
Only `.spec.restoreAfterRestart` from the *BackupConfig* are used for the *Restore* operations.
====

backupRef
^^^^^^^^^
This spec reflects the *Backup* which would be referenced to figure out the *BackupConfig* in use and which backup needs
to be restored.
